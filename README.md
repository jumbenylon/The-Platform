# THE PLATFORM

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

## Design Patterns
If you're contributing to this repo, let's adhere to some of the design patterns below
- folders should be lowercases, separated with hiphens, no camelCase folders
- Above goes for `.js` files.
- TailwindCSS or Styled-components for CSS styling
- Maintain DRY principle
- Always open a branch name starting with the issue number, eg 34-Fix-bug-on-header or fix/34-bug-on-header, feature/35-Add-login-modal
- Try and follow other patterns not mentioned here but used already in the codebase, even better ones are welcome.
